This synthesis and collection of papers are submitted for the degree of pilosophiae doctor (PhD) in atmospheric physics and chemistry at the Section for Meteorology and Oceanography (MetOs), Department of Geosciences, University of Oslo. The work has been performed from March 2015 until November 2019, interrupted by a maternity leave. The reseach has been supervised by Terje Koren Berntsen (MetOs, Cicero), Trude Storelvmo (Metos), Kari Alterskj√¶r (Cicero) and J\'{o}n Egill Kristj\'{a}nsson (MetOs, Deceased 14th August 2016). The project was funded by the Norwegian Research Council through the project EVA (Earth System modelling of climate Variations in the Anthropocene), project number NFR - 229771. The thesis consists of an introduction part and the following papers. Summary of all four papers, including author contributions, are specified in Chapter \ref{sec:papersummary} of the introdution part.\\
