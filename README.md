# TeXthesis
This is a setup for a phd thesis at MetOs at UiO. 
Thanks to Inger Helene Karset for sharing and as far as I am aware, it was  Andreas Vogel  who first put it together and it might have been developed by Ada Gjermundsen and  Christine Smith-Johnsen (also previous phd students at metos). 

The titles are from Inger Helenes thesis: http://urn.nb.no/URN:NBN:no-75899
