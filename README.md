# TeXthesis
This is a setup for a paper based phd thesis at MetOs at UiO.

Thanks to Inger Helene Karset for sharing and as far as I am aware, it was  Andreas Vogel  who first put it together and it might have been developed by Ada Gjermundsen and  Christine Smith-Johnsen (also previous phd students at metos).
